- This is a keymap for my corne keyboard using the zmk firmware.
- I primarily work on Linux machines.
- I have configured it to work with Neovim and tmux, with tiling manager.
- I also use Vimium plugin for Google Chrome and Firefox.
- The configuration in the repo is working well for me.
- Hopefully it can be a good starting point for you as well if you do similar stuff like me.
- The main keymap file is [config/corne.keymap](config/corne.keymap).
